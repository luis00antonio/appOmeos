        <p>The current state of technology makes it possible to transmit the quantum properties of almost any substance from one device to another medium, in our case, water.</p>
        <p>Every being (plant, animal...) has a quantum structure that identifies it. Each component of our cells, each metabolic reaction that occurs in our organism has its own quantum structure. Even a simple thought influences the bioelectric structure of the nervous system. Electromagnetic signals constitute the language of communication between atoms and molecules. Tissue cells have an electrical potential that generates an electromagnetic field. Communication between the cells of the various living tissues is carried out by a system of waves. Each tissue has its own wave rhythm, which in turn conditions the wave rhythm of the organ of which it is a part. When, for whatever reason, this intracellular electromagnetic field is disturbed, intracellular communication is also disturbed and dysfunction occurs, a dysfunction that we perceive through different symptoms. Water, previously exposed to molecular ordering, is able to harmonize the intracellular electromagnetic fields when absorbed by the human body. This generates a synchronous resonance with the cells that make up the biological tissues and regulates their functions.</p>
        <p>With this application the user has the possibility of having at any time and in any place the remedy prescribed by his Homeopathic Doctor. And beyond: you can obtain remedies to alleviate minor ailments without the advice of a professional, for example, insect bites, mild headaches, motion sickness, menstrual discomfort... Given the way of obtaining the remedy, we must note an added virtue to the application, the ecological factor. Indeed, the usual waste generated in the manufacture of a conventional medicine is not generated, there is no packaging, no cartoning or transport of the product. Therefore, we invite you to try this revolutionary technology and enjoy the advantages it brings in obtaining homeopathic remedies.</p>
