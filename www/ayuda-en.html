        <p>The way to find the cure you need and the method of getting it is very simple. The program itself will guide you.</p>
        <p>1.- <b>How to find the remedy you need</b>: From the "remedies" screen you can access a list of remedies sorted alphabetically. Once the process is completed, you will be prompted to prepare the remedy that will alleviate your discomfort.</p>
        <p>2.- <b>Obtaining remedy</b>: Once you have selected the appropriate remedy, and it is displayed, place the device next to a glass or bottle of water. Click on "start" to begin the process. When the time has elapsed, the application will indicate that the process has finished and that you now have your remedy. If your symptom requires two remedies, they must be prepared separately and in different glasses or bottles.</p>
        <p>3.- <b>How to take the remedy </b>: The most efficient way to take the remedy already prepared in water is to drink it in small quantities with a certain frecuency: the more frequent the sips the more acute the symptom is. It is convenient to decrease the frecuency as the symptom subsides. The most commmon frequency for the treatment of almost all symptoms is three or four times a day. In case the symptom is very acute or very persistent, it can be taken every hour, spacing the intakes as the symptom subsides. It is more important the frecuency with which the intakes are made than the amount ingested with each sip. In the case that it is the remedies that are indicated, the way to take them is alternating between the two.</p>
        <p>4.- <b>When to stop taking the remedy?</b> When the symptoms have completely disappeared. If the symptom in question is very chronic or very old, it is advisable to tak it 1 or 2 times a day for several months (since it is not a chemical substance, there is no risk of taking "too much of the remedy"). The dosage does not vary with age, nor if any conventional medication is taken, nor with pregnancy.</p>
